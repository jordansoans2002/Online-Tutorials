	<p>An object is defined within curly brackets. Its not a class but just contains properties of the objects which can also be objects.</p>
	<script>
		var person = {
			name:'John Doe',
			age: 25,
			personality:['kind','loyal'],
			company: {name:'Akshit',color: 'Nigga'}//this is a class wid prop nm and clr
		}
		document.write(person.name);
		console.log(person.personality[1]);
		document.write(person['company'].name);
		console.log(person.friend);//undefined
		person.friend = 'Keisha';
		document.write(person['friend']);
		//you can add objects to the class later too. an object is just like an array except we have value pairs instead of ordered values. each property points to a value
		person['company'].gender = 'boy';
		document.write(person.company['gender']);
